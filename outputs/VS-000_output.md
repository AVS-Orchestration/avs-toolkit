I'm a customer seeking a specific outcome from an agent. Here's my request:

**Success Definition:**
The success of this project is measured by achieving a 95% accuracy rate in generating high-fidelity, human-readable descriptions of technical outcomes, as validated by a panel of three human reviewers.

**Final Product:**
The final product will be a clear, descriptive statement of the specific technical outcome, providing the agent with a comprehensive understanding of the "What" required to achieve this goal. The statement should meet the following requirements:

* Quantitative or binary measure of success (95% accuracy rate)
* High-fidelity quality gate for the human reviewer

**Benefits:**
Achieving this goal will bring significant benefits to me as a customer, including:

* Improved efficiency and productivity through streamlined communication with the agent
* Enhanced user experience and satisfaction by ensuring that the technical outcome is accurately understood and addressed

Now, let's move on to the execution steps!

**Step 1: Validate Context**
To ensure that step 1 was done correctly, I will verify that the context assets provided (path/to/your/file.md and path/to/reference.pdf) are accurate and relevant to the project. This validation ensures that the agent has a solid foundation for understanding my requirements.

**Step 2: Primary Production or Transformation Step**
The primary production or transformation step is to generate the high-fidelity, human-readable description of the technical outcome based on the validated context. This step will involve using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze the context assets and produce a clear, descriptive statement that meets the requirements outlined above.

Please proceed with executing these steps!
