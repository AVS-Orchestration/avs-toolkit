I'm a customer seeking a specific outcome. To define success, I'll provide a clear and descriptive statement of the final product.

**Success Definition:** A high-quality, binary measure of success is achieved when the agent delivers a technical report that accurately defines exactly what success looks like in at least 20 characters, providing a clear, descriptive statement of the final product.

**Requirement 1: Quantitative or Binary Measure of Success.**
The report must include a concise, quantifiable statement that meets the minimum character count requirement (at least 20 characters).

**Requirement 2: High-Fidelity Quality Gate for the Human Reviewer.**
The report must be written in a clear and descriptive manner, making it easy for a human reviewer to understand the specific technical outcome.

**What:** The agent should provide a detailed description of the final product, including its characteristics, features, and benefits. This will enable me, as the customer, to make informed decisions about the project's direction and requirements.

Now, let's explore the benefits of achieving this goal:

**Benefit 1: Improved Efficiency or Productivity.**
By providing a clear and concise definition of success, I can streamline my decision-making process, reducing the time spent on clarifying requirements and increasing productivity.

**Benefit 2: Enhanced User Experience or Satisfaction.**
The agent's report will enable me to create a user-centered approach, ensuring that the final product meets the needs and expectations of its users, leading to increased satisfaction and loyalty.

Now that we've established the success definition and benefits, let's move on to the execution steps:

**Step 1: Describe the First Action the Agent Must Take.**
The agent should start by reviewing the provided context (file.md and reference.pdf) to understand my requirements and goals.

**Validation:** To ensure step 1 was done correctly, I'll provide additional context or clarification if needed. The agent will confirm that they have understood my requirements before proceeding with the next steps.
