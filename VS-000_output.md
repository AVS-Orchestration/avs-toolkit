**Web Research Report**

**Summary:** Unfortunately, web research failed due to rate limit issues with Gemini-Flash-Latest. Despite trying alternative versions, we were unable to complete the research.

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Initial Data Gathering:** We attempted to access various Gemini-Flash versions (2.5, 2.0, and latest) to gather relevant data.
	* Validation: We verified that each attempt was made in a sequential manner, with no concurrent requests.
2. **Primary Production/Transformation Step:** Unfortunately, our attempts were met with a 429 error ("Too Many Requests" - rate limit exceeded).
	* Forensic Check: We conducted a thorough analysis to ensure there were no hallucinations or missteps in the process.

**Conclusion:** Due to the rate limit issues, we were unable to complete the web research. Further attempts will be necessary to overcome this limitation and gather the required data.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Retry with Rate Limit Workarounds:** We recommend implementing rate limit workarounds or using alternative research tools to bypass the limitations.
2. **Prioritize Research Objectives:** In light of these challenges, we suggest re-prioritizing research objectives to focus on more feasible and efficient methods.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Re-attempt Web Research:** Once rate limit issues are addressed, we will re-attempt web research using alternative tools or workarounds.
2. **Review and Refine Research Strategy:** We will review our research strategy to identify areas for improvement and refine our approach to overcome future limitations.
