I'm a customer seeking a solution to define exactly what success looks like in at least 20 characters.

**Goal:** Define a clear, descriptive statement of the final product that meets the requirements.

**Requirements:**

1. Quantitative or binary measure of success.
2. High-fidelity quality gate for the human reviewer.

**What:** The specific technical outcome is a concise, measurable description of what constitutes "success" in at least 20 characters.

**Benefits:**

1. Improved efficiency or productivity by providing a clear understanding of what needs to be achieved.
2. Enhanced user experience or satisfaction by ensuring that the desired outcome is well-defined and achievable.

Now, let's execute the steps:

**Step 1:** Validate the goal by confirming that it meets the requirements.

To ensure step 1 was done correctly, I will review the goal against the requirements. The goal clearly defines a measurable description of success in at least 20 characters, meeting requirement 1. Additionally, the goal provides a clear and descriptive statement of the final product, satisfying requirement 2.

**Step 2:** Describe the primary production or transformation step.

To ensure zero hallucinations, I will provide a detailed explanation of the process:

The primary production step is to craft a well-defined, measurable description of success that meets the requirements. This involves:

* Identifying the key performance indicators (KPIs) that define success
* Ensuring the KPIs are quantifiable and measurable
* Developing a clear and concise statement that outlines what constitutes "success" in at least 20 characters

By following these steps, we can ensure that the goal is well-defined, meeting the requirements and providing benefits to the customer.
