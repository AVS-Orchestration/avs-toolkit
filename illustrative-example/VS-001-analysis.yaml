# THE GOAL: The "Minimum Unique Information" needed to produce the product.
# This defines the "North Star" for the Agent's internal reasoning loop.

goal:
  outcome_statement: "Identify key skills, experiences, and keywords from the job description and raw resume, and generate a strategic plan for resume tailoring."
  success_metrics:
    - "Generated strategic plan clearly outlines resume tailoring approach."
    - "Strategic plan identifies at least 5 key skills/keywords from job description."

# INSTRUCTIONS: Must be "Algorithmically Legible."
# Precise enough for AI execution, clear enough for Human audit.

instructions:
  reasoning_pattern: "Chain-of-Thought"  # Reflection, Planning, or CoT
  execution_steps:
    - step: 1
      action: "Parse provided job description to extract required skills, keywords, responsibilities, and company culture cues."
      validation_rule: "List of extracted requirements is comprehensive and accurate."
    - step: 2
      action: "Parse provided candidate's raw resume to identify relevant experience, education, achievements, and technical proficiencies."
      validation_rule: "List of candidate's relevant attributes is comprehensive and accurate."
    - step: 3
      action: "Perform a detailed gap analysis comparing extracted job requirements with candidate attributes to identify strengths, weaknesses, and tailoring opportunities."
      validation_rule: "Gap analysis report highlights crucial alignment points and discrepancies."
    - step: 4
      action: "Develop a strategic plan for tailoring the resume, including prioritization of candidate's content, specific keywords to integrate, and sections to emphasize or de-emphasize."
      validation_rule: "Strategic plan is actionable, coherent, and directly addresses the gap analysis findings."
  constraints:
    - "Do not hallucinate facts outside the provided Context."
    - "Output must be formatted as a structured strategic plan."

# CONTEXT: The antidote to hallucination.
# Engineering 'The Information Hunt' out of the runtime loop.

# BUSINESS REVIEW: The Human-Agent governance layer.

  quality_gate_checklist:
    - "Does the strategic plan meet the Outcome Statement?"
    - "Is the identified logic still optimal?"
