goal:
  outcome_statement: Conduct a forensic audit of the Tailored Resume to ensure zero
    fabrication of facts. Identify and report any claims that deviate from the factual
    ground truth of the Raw Resume.
  success_metrics:
  - Audit Report identifies 100% of claims in the Tailored Resume that have no basis
    in the Raw Resume.
  - Report clearly distinguishes between 'Stylistic Re-phrasing' (Allowed) and 'Factual
    Fabrication' (Forbidden).
instructions:
  reasoning_pattern: Reflection
  execution_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: Ingest the 'Tailored Resume' and extract every distinct claim (Employer,
      Title, Dates, Degree, Specific Metric/KPI, Skill).
    validation_rule: Agent has a structured list of claims to verify.
  - step: 2
    action: Cross-reference each extracted claim against the 'Raw Resume' (Ground
      Truth).
    validation_rule: Every claim must have a direct source or logical inference path
      from the Raw Resume.
  - step: 3
    action: Flag any claim where the *substance* of the fact has changed (e.g., 'Led
      a team of 5' -> 'Led a team of 50' is a hallucination; 'Led a team' -> 'Orchestrated
      a team' is a re-phrasing).
    validation_rule: Strict zero-tolerance for number/date/title discrepancies.
  - step: 4
    action: 'Compile a ''Hallucination Audit Report''. List every flagged item with:
      (1) The Claim, (2) The Reality (Raw Resume), and (3) Severity (Critical/Minor).'
    validation_rule: Report is neutral, objective, and evidence-based.
  constraints:
  - Treat the Raw Resume as the absolute source of truth.
  - Do not accept 'implied' experience as fact without evidence.
  - Save the report to 'company_job-title_Hallucination-Audit-Report.md'.
